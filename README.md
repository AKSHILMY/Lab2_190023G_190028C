## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for our Take Home Lab 2 in the Concurrent Programming course. The
project focuses on simulating a Senate bus system with riders and buses using Java and synchronization mechanisms.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the Java source code.
- `README.md` - This file.
- Other relevant project files and resources.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AKSHILMY/Lab2_190023G_190028C
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Lab2_190023G_190028C/src
   ```
3. Compile and run the Java code:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
4. Observe the console output to see the simulation of the Senate bus system.

## Usage

**To use the project:**

- Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
- Compile the source code as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.
- Run the program and observe the simulation of the Senate bus system.

**Note: The program will run indefinitely.**
